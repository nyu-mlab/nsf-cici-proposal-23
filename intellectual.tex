\section{Intellectual Merits}


A few intellectual merits regarding this particular proposal. Number one is the usability study. We will need a Will you know this will be a study on understand how the scientists use such networks and their existing concerns. And you know what their ideal solution might be for such networks. So, user study usability, the understanding usability and needs would be the first major intellectual merit number two is that we're able to integrate with existing systems that is agnostic of the hardware. We design our system in a modular manner such that it hopefully will work for Cisco IT WILL should work for software defined networks and number three, it's a reinforcement learning based system you know, we can learn the about the applications of traffic from users from Zeke. And you know, that allows us to better catch anomalies and or better label these endpoints. I'm sorry, these are destination hosts. I think these are the three high level intellectual merits



Usability.
UI/UX
Automatic tagging to help non-experts make informed decisions.

Integration with existing systems.
Off the shelf hardware and software
Fallback in cases of human failure
