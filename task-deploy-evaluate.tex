\section{Task 3: Deploying and evaluating the system}

\paragraph{Challenges} XXX

Deploying to NYU's HSRN. Co-PI will deploy. He works in NYU Research IT infrastructure. He manages the HSRN.

Understanding user experience. We will conduct surveys, semi-structured interviews, focus groups. We will also track interactions on the dashboard (with consent).

Understanding user failures. We will analyze zeek logs to look for cases missed by users. too broadly defined by researchers; missed security bugs.  Is it our annotation problem?

We will explore feedback loop back to dashboard to highlight these errors (hey because traffic got slower) and help the user make more informed decisions next time.

Sustainability plan. Co-PI Pahle will train student workers. He will make sure to keep the infrastructure around. He will be a lead to maintain this infrastructure.

\paragraph{Expected outcome} First deployed on a small subset of users. Gradually increasing in size as we conduct more studies.

// From: Jeremy
	-Measureable
-reduction in security threats (during testing and demonstrated by monitoring
data during implementation).
	-improvements in large, high-speed data transfers.
	-reduction of latency in AR/VR/MR and robotics applications.


\paragraph{Lead investigator} PI Huang and Co-PI Pahle will work together on deployment. Co-PI Cappos will advise on XXX.
