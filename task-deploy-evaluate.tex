\section{Task 3: Deploying and evaluating the system}




Now come task number three, task number three will evaluate our whole system, both from a usability and from a security perspective. So it has three A will evaluate the usability, we will conduct regular interviews and surveys to understand how easy it is for users to use, for example, focus groups, we will also collect telemetry from telemetry from the dashboard, to see whether people are how people use it, what buttons, they click how long it takes for them to specify a flow, if they encounter any errors, and we will have random to the patient's ask them to, to to to just in time surveys to get the feedback in real time. So that's the first part understanding user feedback. The second part measures performance, I'm sorry, measures security. We wanted to see how often the IDs as Zeke gets triggered through what means is it because we made a mistake, the user makes a mistake? How often does it go to the network administrators? How often does our our system go through, you know, reinforcement learning. So these are you know, the task three B's meant to measure how often the dashboard isn't able to handle and you would have to defer to the action of Zeke, the IDs to catch the actions and how good is IDs in catching these actions, you know, by sis admins, etc. And want to measure this on a per researcher level and on aggregate level. So maybe we're good in it for certain workloads, but may not be good for other workloads. So this is the goal of three B to evaluate the system. And that's pretty much the entire proposal. Right?




Deploying to NYU's HSRN. Co-PI will deploy. He works in NYU Research IT infrastructure. He manages the HSRN.

Understanding user experience. We will conduct surveys, semi-structured interviews, focus groups. We will also track interactions on the dashboard (with consent).

Understanding user failures. We will analyze zeek logs to look for cases missed by users. too broadly defined by researchers; missed security bugs.  Is it our annotation problem?

We will explore feedback loop back to dashboard to highlight these errors (hey because traffic got slower) and help the user make more informed decisions next time.

Sustainability plan. Co-PI Pahle will train student workers. He will make sure to keep the infrastructure around. He will be a lead to maintain this infrastructure.




\paragraph{Measuring errors} How often did Zeek IDS get triggered?


\paragraph{Expected outcome} First deployed on a small subset of users. Gradually increasing in size as we conduct more studies.

// From: Jeremy
	-Measureable
-reduction in security threats (during testing and demonstrated by monitoring
data during implementation).
	-improvements in large, high-speed data transfers.
	-reduction of latency in AR/VR/MR and robotics applications.


\paragraph{Lead investigator} PI Huang and Co-PI Pahle will work together on deployment. Co-PI Cappos will advise on XXX.
